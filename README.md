# Latent Linear Adjustment autoencoders: A novel method for estimating and simulating dynamic precipitation at high resolution

This repository contains the code of the autoencoder model proposed in "Latent Linear Adjustment autoencoders: A novel method for estimating and simulating dynamic precipitation at high resolution" (TODO: add arxiv/gmd link). In the manuscript, we have demonstrated how Latent Linear Adjustment autoencoders can be applied for dynamical adjustment at high resolution and for emulating dynamically-induced variability in daily precipitation fields. Futher applications such as regional detection & attribution, statistical downscaling or transfer learning between models are conceivable.

This README is not intended to be completely self-explanatory, and should be read alongside the manuscript. Below we give an overview of the model, followed by detailed instructions how to reproduce the results reported in the manuscript. 

## Model
Building on variational autoencoders, we introduce the Latent Linear Adjustment autoencoder which enables estimation of the contribution of a coarse-scale atmospheric circulation proxy to daily precipitation at high-resolution and in a spatially coherent manner. 

The schematic below illustrates a standard autoencoder that encodes daily precipitation fields to the latent space _L_ which are subsequently decoded to yield the reconstructions on the right hand side.

To allow for the climate applications of interest, we extend a standard VAE by adding a linear component _h_ to the architecture. To predict circulation-induced precipitation fields, the Latent Linear Adjustment autoencoder combines the linear component _h_, which models the relationship between circulation and the latent space of an autocoder, with the autoencoder's nonlinear decoder. This is illustrated in the schematic below - here, the precipitation fields on the right hand side show the predictions of circulation-induced precipitation.

To allow for the linearity between circulation and the latent space, the model is trained with an additional penalty in the cost function that encourages this linearity. The proposed model hence leverages robustness advantages of linear models as well as the flexibility of deep neural networks.

## Installing dependencies

You need Python 3.7. All dependencies are specified in ``requirements.txt``. To create a virtual environment and install them, run:

```
virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

We provide a sample data set which is available on Zenodo: 

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3949748.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3949748)

The sample data set is a subset of the CRCM5-LE ([Leduc et al. 2019](https://journals.ametsoc.org/jamc/article/58/4/663/336/The-ClimEx-Project-A-50-Member-Ensemble-of-Climate)) and preprocessed as described in our manuscript (TODO: add link). The original data can be accessed at the [ClimEx data Access page](https://www.climex-project.org/en/data-access).

To correctly load the data, you need to copy the file [``settings.py``](https://github.com/christinaheinze/climate-ae-refac/blob/release/python/settings.py) (TODO: adjust link after moving the repo) and rename it to ``local_settings.py``. In ``local_settings.py``, specify (a) where the data is located in ``DATA_PATH``, and (b) where the output should be saved in ``OUT_PATH``. 


## Running experiments

The commands to run the experiments are detailed in ``python/run-experiments.sh``. Note that you need to add the path of the [``python``](https://github.com/christinaheinze/climate-ae-refac/tree/release/python) (TODO: adjust link after moving the repo) directory to your ``PYTHONPATH`` (see ``python/run-experiments.sh``). 

The first step consists of training the Latent Linear Adjustment autoencoder model. From the ``python`` directory run:

```
python3.7 climate_ae/models/ae/main_ae.py
```

By default, the hyperparameters from the file ``python/climate_ae/models/ae/configs/config_dyn_adj_precip.json`` will be used which correspond to the settings needed to reproduce  the precipitation results reported in the manuscript. For temperature, the corresponding hyperparameters are given in ``python/climate_ae/models/ae/configs/config_dyn_adj_temp.json``.

Each trained model is associated with a so-called ``CHECKPOINT_ID`` which is needed to load a trained model. The ``CHECKPOINT_ID`` is returned as the last logging statement when training the autoencoder and it is also saved in the model outputs that are written to ``OUT_PATH``.

After training the autoencoder, the linear model can be refitted non-iteratively (keeping the autoencoder parameter fixed) and a number of evaluation plots are produced with the following command. The ``CHECKPOINT_ID`` from the trained autoencoder needs to be passed here, such that the correct model is loaded.

```
python3.7 climate_ae/models/ae/main_linear.py --checkpoint_id='CHECKPOINT_ID' --precip=1
```

Finally, the weather generator can be trained using the following command, again passing the ``CHECKPOINT_ID`` from the trained autoencoder:

```
python3.7 climate_ae/models/ae/main_generator.py --checkpoint_id='CHECKPOINT_ID' --precip=1
```

* ``precip``: Flag whether the loaded model was trained for precipitation (otherwise temperature).
* ``save_nc_files``: Flag whether to save nc files with (original as well as emulated) predictions.

## Pre-trained models

We provide the checkpoints of the models used to produce the results in the manuscript on Zenodo: 

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3950045.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3950045)

The file ``checkpoints.zip`` needs to be extracted into the directory ``OUT_PATH``. 

For precipitation, the ``CHECKPOINT_ID`` is ``nKGagmsKDb_4249785``. For temperature, it is ``LDifH9DdVh_4383207``. Hence, to e.g. refit the linear model non-iteratively and to produce the evaluation plots as above, run the following command: 

```
python3.7 climate_ae/models/ae/main_linear.py --checkpoint_id='nKGagmsKDb_4249785' --precip=1
```
